/**
 * Detects if a point hits any of two circles.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * To use this program, 
 * provide eight floating-point numbers separated by spaces as input when prompted. 
 * The program will determine whether the given point hits either or both of the two circles 
 * and provide the corresponding output message.
 *
 * TODO: Documentation
 * This documentation explains the functionality and usage of the provided Java code, 
 * which is responsible for performing hit detection between two circles 
 * and a point in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. 
 * The program determines whether the point hits either of the two circles, 
 * both circles, or none of them.
 * Overview
 * The code is divided into a single class named HitDetection. 
 * It contains two main methods: 
 * countSubstrings(String input) and run(). 
 * The main() method is the entry point of the program.
 * countSubstrings(String input)
 * This method is responsible for counting the number of substrings that can be generated 
 * from a given input string. 
 * It generates all possible substrings using simple logic that can pass cyclomatic complexity test.
 * Each substring is printed (optional), and the total count of substrings is returned.
 * Parameters
 *     input (String): The input string from which substrings are generated.
 * Method Implementation
 *     Initialize an integer variable totalCount to keep track of the total number of substrings.
 *     Use a nested loop structure:
 *         The outer loop iterates through the starting index of the substring, denoted by start.
 *         The inner loop iterates through the ending index of the substring, denoted by end.
 *     Extract a substring from start to end using the substring() method.
 *         Print each generated substring (optional).
 *         Increment the totalCount for each valid substring.
 *     Return the totalCount.
 * run()
 * The run() method is the main execution method of the program. 
 * It reads eight floating-point numbers from the standard input (console) 
 * and performs hit detection between two circles and a point.
 * Method Implementation
 *     Declare and initialize variables for various input values, 
 * including the coordinates of two circle centers (xCenter1, yCenter1, xCenter2, yCenter2), 
 * the radii of the circles (radius1, radius2), and the coordinates of the point (xPoint, yPoint).
 *     Read the eight floating-point numbers from the console using a Scanner.
 *     Parse and assign the input values to their respective variables 
 * based on the order in which they are read.
 *     Check if either of the circle radii is negative. If so, 
 * output "input error" and terminate the program.
 *     Calculate the distances from the point to the centers of both circles 
 * using the distance formula.
 *     Determine whether the point is inside or on the border of each circle by 
 * comparing the calculated distances to the circle radii.
 *     Based on the hit detection results, output one of the following messages:
 *         "The point hits both circles" (if the point hits both circles).
 *         "The point hits the first circle" (if the point hits the first circle only).
 *         "The point hits the second circle" (if the point hits the second circle only).
 *         "The point does not hit either circle" (if the point does not hit any circle).
 * Main Method
 * The main(String[] args) method serves as the entry point of the program. 
 * It creates an instance of the HitDetection class 
 * and invokes its run() method to execute the hit detection logic.
 * Usage
 * To use this program, provide eight floating-point numbers separated 
 * by spaces as input when prompted. 
 * The program will determine whether the given point hits either or both of the two circles 
 * and provide the corresponding output message.
 * Output
 * The program outputs one of the following messages:
 *     "The point hits both circles"
 *     "The point hits the first circle"
 *     "The point hits the second circle"
 *     "The point does not hit either circle"
 *     "input error" (if either circle radius is negative).
 * Note
 *     The code includes optional comments for clarification.
 *     The countSubstrings() method is included in the code 
 * but is not directly related to the hit detection functionality 
 * and may be used for other purposes.
 * END TODO
