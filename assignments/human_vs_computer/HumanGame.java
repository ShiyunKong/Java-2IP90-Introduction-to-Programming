/** 
 * Number guessing game for humans.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * This program is a number guessing game designed for humans. 
 * In this game, you need to guess an integer number between 
 * 0 and 99 that the computer has randomly selected. 
 * You have a maximum of seven tries to guess the correct number. 
 * After the game is finished, the program will show you an overview of 
 * what happened during the game.
 * 
 * Enter a seed number, and the computer will think of a number between 0 and
 * 99 that you have to guess in at most seven tries. Afterwards, you see your
 * guessing history, so you can learn to better play the game.
 * 
 * TODO: Documentation
 * The purpose of this program is to allow a user to 
 * play a number guessing game where the computer generates 
 * a random number between 0 and 99 (inclusive), 
 * and the user has to guess the generated number within seven attempts.
 * Here are the specific input requirements for the program:
 * The user is asked to enter an arbitrary number as a seed for the random number generator. 
 * This seed will determine the sequence of random numbers generated during the game.
 * The user can make up to seven guesses to identify the randomly generated code.
 * The user is expected to input integer numbers as guesses.
 * The program will provide feedback for each guess:
        If the guess is higher than the generated code, it will print "lower."
        If the guess is lower than the generated code, it will print "higher."
        If the guess is correct, it will print "Good guess! You won."
        If the user exhausts all seven attempts without guessing correctly, 
        the program will print "No more guesses, you lost."

 * After the game concludes, the program will display a guessing history, 
 * showing how close each guess was to the actual code. 
 * It uses "X" to represent the user's guess, "|" to represent the code, 
 * and dots to fill the remaining positions in a line of 100 characters.
 * The program will repeat the game if needed or terminate based on user interaction.
 * The program begins by asking the user for a seed, generates a random code, 
 * and then proceeds with the guessing game, taking user input and providing feedback 
 * until a win or loss condition is met.
 * END TODO
